你从不期望家人会理解你的工作

183
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,370
只要让他们明白你是为了他们 才这么做 那就够了

潜心于部署 但是

正如我和士官长所说
It's like Chief and I said,

193
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,540
一旦入队
right at the beginning of this platoon

194
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,800
一旦我们步入战场
Once we step off on campaign,

195
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,860
一旦我们整装待发
once it reversed ready for downranged,

196
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,860
一心回家的念头就该抛之脑后
everything back home is be unbalanced

197
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,390
虽不知会谁死谁生 
we will not worth the dead of each other or self,

198
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,380
但步入战场 我们要心无留恋
we get over there, something out of recommendative

199
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,490
家中纠纷
Things aren't right with the family,

200
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,060
钱财紧缺还有其他一些琐事
things aren't right with the finance or something's off.

201
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,330
你都需抛之脑后 所以
It's gonna put us all out of balance. So..

202
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,100
这点在出发前每个人都要铭记于心
we need to had that typed before we launch.

203

还有疑问吗 现在就说

这里的每个人都是彼此的后盾
Everybody's got each other's back.

出发前希望大家明确一点

完成任务是我们唯一的目的
All our focus is on the mission.

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,670
为那些已经牺牲的战友 
For all those been downranged,

为我们和爱我们的人 干杯!

神明的真主 世界的主宰者

才能在审判日得到和平

282
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,140
在这需要向你们解释一下
on this explanation to you,

283
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,470
我们并不是分裂主义者

我们有权阻止你们这些
We're setting on all legal part of anyone

不管是自愿还是被迫
be you an agent are wilingly or unwillingly

286
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,070
成为特工的人 来残害我们的国民
assisting the agenda of genocide of our people,

287
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,120
来用条条框框的文法限制我们
by demanding that we obey certain rules

288
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,420
想要试图侵占所有穆斯林的国家
and by your continous occupation of all Muslim countries,

289
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,340
在真主阿拉的引领下 我们必须采取行动

美国佬 我们担惊受怕的活着

艾比・莎保是一个车臣恐怖分子
Abu shabal is a Chechen terrorist

293
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,390
他与斯兰学校大屠杀事件有关

印度尼西亚和菲律宾的士兵集训营

296
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,280
如今 克里斯托 和艾比・莎保之间的关联
Now, the connection between Christo and Abbu Shabal

297
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,550
变得更加捉摸不透了
is so a little bit fuzzy,

298
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,150
但是如果莫拉莱斯在为艾比・莎保做事的话
But if this was the lead that Morales was working on

299
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,640
也许这是他被绑架的原因 长官?
it could be why she was abducted.Senior?

300
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,270
以上就是莫拉莱斯小姐的资料
All right, this is a personal recovery of Miss Morales.

301
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,360
有疑问吗?

302
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,250
长官
See, Chief.

303
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,420
你有敌营里巡逻队人数的
If you have any  update resource, and tell us numbers inside the camp,

304
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,790
最新数据吗?
what about roving patrols?

305
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,030
8到10个人左右
Maybe 8 to 10 Bro

306
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,040
但是我们对巡逻队一无所知
but we don't know anything about roving patrols

307
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,170
所以你
you just gonna have to assume that's

308
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,480
只能假设他们布防严密
all working around the squared away

309
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,240
这些人也是干这行的
you just did for a living too

310
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,500
长官 我们需要搜寻哪种武器?
Senior, what kind of weapons on target are we looking at?

311
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,480
重型武器 这些家伙是毒贩

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,860
0.5英寸口径的重型机枪 猜不准
for the course out there,we don't know.

314
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,080
所以 如果装的下 
So, if there is a weapons in place out there,

315
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,430
我建议你们带上火箭筒
I suggest you guys bring rockets

316
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,130
当然 可别把火箭弹当子弹玩
of course rockets and bullets don't match,

317
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,710
尽量保证一击必杀 
so make sure you got a clear shot.

318
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,510
好了 还有疑问吗?
All right, what else?

319
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
有没有情报说她的伤势如何?
Any idea wether she's ambulatory or not?

320
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
案发现场有很多血迹
There's ton of blood on the scene,

321
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,410
不过大部分都是罗斯的
and alot of it was Mr Ross'

322
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,810
我们确信莫拉莱斯小姐也受伤了
We confirmed that Ms. Morales may has blood there too

323
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,300
但是这些家伙都是些野蛮人
But these guys are savages.

324
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,890
你们得做好抬着她出来的准备
So, you're gonna have to assume that she is..non ambulatory

325
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,170
所以带副担架吧
so you gonna have to bring stuff to carry her out.

326
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,710

借助美国大众媒体的力量来制造一场大恐慌吧

但总是失望而归

要么变成了混蛋 要么变成了无趣之人
Some become asshole, as other boring

533
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:53,000
嘿 而你 尤里 你却没让我失望
Hey, it is nice not to be disappointed Yuri

534
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,920
我不叫尤里
It's not my name

535
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,870
我知道 你叫穆罕穆德・艾比・莎保 
I know. Muhammad Abu Shabal,

536
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,490
莎保之子

拜托 但你爸爸叫尤金
Come on, your father's name is Yevgeny

- It's changed. - Yeah, I think it's changed

539
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,910
所以时隔多年才和你再次相见
That's why this is the last time I might have to see each other for quite some time.

540
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,000
因为我一直隐姓埋名的活着
For am I have to find a hole to hide in.

我不懂你为什么要这么做

00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,480
我被中情局盯上了 
I'm being watched by the CIA,

00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,000
摆脱不掉他们的监视

不言而喻
This is the most oppotunities present itself

他们训练也长达一年了

我费尽心血的

交易依旧成立 尤里 我说我会提前退休
The deal stands, Yuri.Just because I've taken early retirement,

552
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,080
可没说在这期间一直可以讨价还价

553
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,530
还有很多事没解决呢
There is so much to be done.

554

会解决的 没有我也行!
And it will be, just without me!

555
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,490
你可以拿我的名声和别人合作
You have to use my trust in associates

556
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,600
- 这对我不利! - 喂!
- It's not so good for me! - Hey!

557
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,580
闭嘴!给我闭嘴!
Hey, shut up! Shut up! Stop!

558
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,850
你就会胡说八道!
You're fcuking bullshit!

559
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,660
这决定不好 不会起作用的
It's not good, it doesn't work

560
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,320
- 你不能这么改革! - 换汤不换药而已
- You can't change it like that! - Nothing changes, nothing.

561
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,590
你刚刚说什么都变了 但是实质却没变? 
You just told me everything change,

562
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,460
什么意思? 什么意思?

你知道我怎么费劲心思到这里的吗?

你知道我为什么要冒险来这里吗?

你懂吗?
Do you have any idea?

566
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,180
你不知道 你个垃圾 躲在象牙塔里享乐 
No, you shit, you live up here, this ivory tower,

568
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:37,720
美国理查德军舰 - 中美洲海岸
USS BON HOMME RICHARD - CENTRAL AMERICAN COAST

569
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,270
嗨 长官 米奇情况如何?

Great job, small check in those assholes, get Morales back

573
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:53,180
对米奇来说这会是个教训 
It's a blunt deal for Mikey better get

574
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,800
同时也给你们上了一课如何扎实工作
to tell you what was the solid work.

575
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,960
长官 把这话传达下去 
So Chief, make sure you get that down of the boys right away.

576
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,070
- 懂不? - 遵命
- Do you hear me? - Sure

577
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,210
好的 还有就是莫拉莱斯
All right. And Morales.

578
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,470
莫拉莱斯就比较难搞了
Morales was one tough chick.

579
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,650
在事情变得难以想象前 
But she should've got in this stuff up to change a lot faster

580
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,140
她得尽快恢复帮我们理清线索
because this thing is way bigger than we thought it was.

581
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,250
怎么会变这样? 
How was that?

582
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,500
我本以为就是一场切断武器供应的行动而已
I thought this was cut and dry arm search recovery

583
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,340
本来是这样 直到破解了那个手机的内容
Yeah, wasn't until we got into that phone

584
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,280
那只你们从那个鬼地方捡来的手机
that you guys picked up at that shit hole.

585
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,940
想来总觉得事情有些不对劲 
It turn me out of something just not look right at all.

586
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,290
觉得什么不对劲?
And what's not right about it?

587
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,140
克里斯托和莎保比我想象的还要密切
Christo and Shabal are a lot closer than I thought they were.

588
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,740
莎保是核心人物
Shabal is a wild core man

589
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,520
他是个老圣战主义者 
He's an old jahadi,

590
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,940
对金钱和毒品交易从不掉以轻心
that couldn't give a rest-ass about money or drugs.

591
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,190
所以他的朋友克里斯托也是如此 那个毒贩?
Yeah, that tells his friend Christo, the dope dealer?

592
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,310
他不是毒贩
He's not a dealer man,

593
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,560
他是个走私贩
he's a smugler.

594
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,450
这在玩我吧
You've gotta be kidding me.

595
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,930
我也被耍了 
that is exactly what I'm thinking.

596
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:41,230
莎保想杀美国人 克里斯托知道如何走私入境
Shabal wants to kill Americans, Christo knows how to get fcukers inside America.

597
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,570
大麻烦要降临了兄弟们 
This could be big trouble in little timing fellas.

598
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,210
他们想要袭击美国本土
They're gonna hit us at home.

599
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,310
我刚刚和头谈了此事 
I just got done talking to boss,

600
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,950
特遣部队的工作部署马上会着手开始
on the spec of task force, this is gonna go down.

601
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,320
阿加伊和雷待命 在两小时内随时准备出发 
I need Ajay and Ray stand by to launch for NSR in 2 hours.

602
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,010
看来他们是要在去非洲的路上
They gonna get some frigging

603
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,650
拦截些花鼠之类的东西了
flower mouse on the way to Africa.

604
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:57,860
为什么去非洲
Why Africa?

605
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,640
在手机的资料里发现那里有个机场
We pended airfield there by the phone that you got?

606
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,410
我觉得莎保在西行进行武器交易时会路经那里
And I think that Shabal is gonna be there during weapon transfer on his way West.

607
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,400
你说的西行是指去哪里?
When you say "West", what do we talking about?

608
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,510
墨西哥西部?
Mexico West?

609
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,200
是的
Yeah

610
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,610
墨西哥西部
Mexico West

611
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,640
这是最坏的情况
It's the worst case scenario

612
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,570
你俩还有其余的人都留在这里
You two and the rest of platoon are gonna stay here

613
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,630
待命 如果情况恶化 
and standby, you'll be the primary assault for worst case

614
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,660
危机逼近本土 你们会是先发部队
that goes down anywhere near America

615
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:18,360
遵命
Check

616
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,250
遵命

617
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,850
他们现身时你会在这里吗?
You gonna be around for any questions as they came up?

618
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:26,050
不行 克里斯托给我摆了一道 然后消失了
No man. Christo, he put a Roman Polanski at my ass and disappeared.

619
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,310
所以我得去和海豹四队取得联络
So I'm gonna link up for SEAL Team 4

620
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,760
我们要去南太平洋把他打个落花流水
and we're gonna go hunt his ass down in the South Pacific

621
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,300
所以说 我可能脱不开身
So straight up, my ties and palm trees so maybe...

622
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,280
放心吧 兄弟 我们会抓到他的
Yeah brother, I go get them

623
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,650
保重 一切顺利
Be cool. take it easy

624
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,900
恭喜你当爸爸了 中尉
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant

625
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,750
所有人都知道了?
Does everybody know?

626
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,470
要员们都知道了
All the important people

627
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,740
谁家要员?
The important people to who?

628
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,610
你?

629
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,910
估计是
I guess so

630
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,360
我要去看看那帮小子了
I'm gonna go brood the boys

631
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,600
嗨 等下
Hey hold on one second

632
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,600
我带了这个想要你提前看一下
I brought it here cause I want you to read it before

633
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,110
我是个值得信任的长官
I'm trusted officer...

634
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,790
但是老实说
and but to be honest with you

635
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,010
我曾考虑打报告
I was thinking to calling the commander

636
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,370
让你回家
trying to get you home

637
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,620
但是事情愈演愈烈
And now worse picked up so much

638
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,120
觉得你非在不可了
I feel like we really need you here

639
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,350
你还记得我们在阿拉玛最后一次巡航吗?
You remember our last cruise on Alamar?

640
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,330
记得
Yeah

641
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,540
当最后要完成任务的时候 你说我可以走了
When you got that final turn over op you said I don't need to be there

642
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,160
我当时躺在床上 一心只想着回家
I was lying in bed, and I realized all the thing I need do now was go home

643
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,650
但是要是那时候有个万一
But if something went south in your op

644
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,590
我绝对会终身抱憾
I would always regret not being there with you

645
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,440
我很感激你一直以来的照顾 戴夫
I appreciate you're taking care of me big time, Dave

646
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,190
不过有时我也还是会厚皮脸的偷懒
But I'm working sometimes with the brass

647
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,410
要是可以
If I can

648
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,650
事情慢慢好转
And things slow down

649
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,130
我就给自己放个两周假
I'm gonna get 2 weeks off

但要是不行
But if it doesn't

653
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,970
我就只能把这信

After 9/1 1 , my uncle sent a bunch out for the pIatoon,

781
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:21,150
好吧  其实我也不想给你
AII right, good. I didn't want to give it to you anyway.

782
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,150
除此之外  我很确定我看见
Besides, man, I'm pretty sure I saw you

783
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,240
几天前你把什么东西放到了你的口袋里
putting something in your cargo pocket the other day.

784
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,030
- 那是什么  - 我知道我见过你那个

785
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,910
口袋里装了什么东西

是什么
What is it?

787

- 真棒  - 我爸爸把他给了我

棒极了
Fabulous

793
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,110
我叫它"星际飞船"
I believe it's called "starship"

794
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,030
"星际飞船"?
"starship"?

795
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,670
我喜欢听你说"星际飞船"的口音
I love the way you say "starship"

796
01:02:58,670 --> 01:02:59,690
很像俄国人
It's like Russian

797
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,930
就像那个在星际迷航里的家伙 叫什么来着?
Like guy in Star Trek, what's his name?

798
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,630
史科特 不好意思 斯科特
Scotty, I'm sorry, Scott

799
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,900
我不知道
I would not

800
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,270
你没看过星际迷航?
You never seen Star Trek?

801
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:06,730
没看过
No

802
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,850
怎么可能
That's insane

803
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,150
我有个问题 老兄
So, here's the problem, pal

804
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,950
你是一直很有钱
You're with a lot of money

805
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,310
还是你曾经很有钱?
Or you were with a lot of money?

806
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,710
我想我一直很有钱
I believe I still have

807
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:15,580
真的?
You do?

808
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,210
真的
Yes

809
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,180
好吧
All right

810
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,110
老实告诉你真相吧
Let me tell you how the world works there

811
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,000
克里斯克
Chrisco ...

812
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,390
是克里斯托
It's Christo

813
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:21,900
什么?
sorry?

814
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,440
克里斯托
Christo

815
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,250
哦 懂了
oh, of course

816
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,380
我不介意
Oh it's ok

817
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,270
老实告诉你真实的世界到底是怎样的吧
Let me tell you how the world really works

818
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:26,780
请说
please

819
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:27,940
这个船不再是你的了
This is no longer your boat

820
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,760
从我步入那个门开始 
Since I walk through that door,

821
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,350
你就不是当初那个有钱人了 不是了
you're not the same guy you used to be. You just not.

822
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,800
这些我无能为力
There's nothing I can do to stop that

823
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,340
我也帮不了你
Nothing I can do to help you right now

824
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,850
除非你愿意
unless you let me help you

825
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,860
我们可以一起合作 兄弟 我和你
We need to do this together pal, you and me

826
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:44,890
你和这群圣战主义者合作感觉如何?
So, how is you think you working with these jihadi folks then?

827
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,120
你是犹太人 对不?
Your're Jewish, right?

828
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,220
莎保是...什么?
Shabal is ...what?

829
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,040
你有发小吗?
Have you ever had a friend that you grew up with?

830
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:57,800
什么?
Sorry?

831
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,700
你有发小吗?
Have you ever had a friend that you grew up with?

832
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,200
有
Yes

833
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,100
有共同的兴趣爱好 像足球之类的
Like play interest, like soccer..

834
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,190
或者你们都玩些什么 棒球吗?
Or what would you play, base ball probably, right?

835
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:04,770
差不多
probably

836
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:05,720
是啊 是啊
Ya ya

837
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,820
然后大家各奔东西 几年后又重新相遇
And anyone has his separate ways, and some years later you meet up

838
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:12,290
但是你完全没有认出他
And you totally didn't recognize the person

839
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,430
这就是我和莎保
That's what I have been with Shabal

840
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,160
我们有共同的爱好
We share a common interest

841
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,830
所以他有些与众不同的念头
So, he came up with his incredible idea

842
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,210
来自于他的信仰
because of his beliefs

843
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,810
我不需要被他同化
I don't necessarily share his beliefs

844
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,410
但他是个聪明人
But he's a smart guy

845
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:27,960
你知道吗?
You know?

846
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,120
就像
Almost like ...

847
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,230
你知道的 就像
you know, almost like...

848
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,910
像 这就是我
like, this is me.

849
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:39,840
而那是莎保
and that's Shabal

850
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:41,150
是吗?
Is it?

851
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,890
美国人就是中间者
And America is in between

852
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:43,530
中间者?
Is it?

853
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,100
就是这样
Yeah

854
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,610
很酷的理论 不是吗?
Cool concept, no?

855
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:48,860
- 这个? - 是的
- Right here? - Yes

856
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,590
你把这个当做一场游戏吗?
You think this is some kind of game?

857
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,990
是吗?你觉得这么做挺好玩?
Do you? You find this amusing?

858
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:57,640
我不觉得
I'm not find ...

859
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,530
你知道你都做了什么吗?
Do you realize what you're doing here?

860
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,410
黑胡分队呼叫基地
Blackbeard actual to Blackbeard Main

861
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,110
目标布瑞沃
Host nation counterpart secured target Bravo

862
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:08,440
报告清除完毕 允许想目标阿尔法移动
Report strike all.You're clear to move on target Alpha

863
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,710
收到 像目标行进中
Roger Main, clear to target

864
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,840
我只和家人坦白
The only people I answer to is my family

865
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:19,780
和我的妻子和孩子
to my wife and to my child

866
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,870
其他一律免谈
and nobody else

867
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,110
赶时间办事吗?
Running late somewhere?

868
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:25,540
06:04
6 after 4

869
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,320
真的?
Really?

870
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,170
是的
Yeah

871
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:27,950
然后
So ...

872
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:29,420
问题是 兄弟
Here's the problem pal

873
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,200
你爱你的家人 是吧?
You do love your family don't you?

874
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:34,250
是的
Yes I do

875
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,710
那你女儿呢?
And what about your daughter?

876
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,200
我女儿怎么了?
what about my daughter?

877
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,180
你想见她吗?
Are you looking forward to seeing her again?

878
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:41,050
每时每刻都在想她
Every minute on my life

879
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,920
我给你看这些 是想让你考虑清楚
I wanted you to see that,  so you can think about something

880
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,300
一些事情
very seriously

881
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,080
因为你的余生可能会在某个牢房里度过
Because you're gonna be sitting in a box somewhere

882
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,800
得到妥善和人道的待遇
You'll be treated properly and humanely

883
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,810
这孩子会长大成人 成家立业
That girl is gonna grow up, and she's gonna get married

884
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,730
而你的妻子则会另觅良人
and your wife is gonna find someone else

885
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,900
你会失去一切
And you're gonna miss everything

886
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,050
要是我做了一些
If I had done something

887
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,150
危及家庭的事情
that would endanger my family

888
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,280
我会像你一样感同深受
I would feel just like you do right now

889
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,960
你能保证不动我家人吗?
Do you promise not to touch my family?

890
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,820
我永远不会动你的家人
I would never touch your family

891
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:49,390
永远不会
I would not

892
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,060
你听过
Are you familiar with ...

893
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,980
瓷质球体炸弹吗?
"ceramic bullbearings"?

894
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,220
没有听过
No

895
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,100
那就想象一下 16件装满
Just imagine 16 suicide vests

896
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,870
瓷质球体炸弹的自爆背心
filled with ceramic bullbearings

897
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,450
可以逃脱任何金属探测器的检测
Slipping by every metal detector

898
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,180
通过美国所有检查站的检查
and every check-point in your country.

899
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,320
你觉得你们国家的经济会因此萧条吗?
Do you think your economy's fcuked now?

900
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,670
先想想媒体会作何反应
Just think what the Media is gonna do with this

901
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,520
911和这个比起来就黯然失色了
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fcuking walking park,

902
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,410
没有可比性
the Grand Central Park

903
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,480
所以 你说
So, you're telling me ..

904
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:36,240
有16个圣战主义分子
there is 16 jahadis

905
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,300
身穿自杀背心

How can you stop this?

长官 目标已自爆 一切安全
Chief, target blasting up, everything secure

953
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,530
艾克彻  任务还未完成

954
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:57,050
随时待命 任务只完成了一半
Stand by for follow one You only got half that you had at cell

955
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,820
目标已完全 长官

956
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,380
战斗还未结束
This fight isn't over yet

957
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,170
现在听好
Now listen,

958
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:04,320
另一半目标会利用墨西卡利地下通道
the other half that cell's gonna be crossing the border using a tunnel network

959
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,810
在上午七点过境
from Mexicali at 0700

960
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:07,860
我们会和当地政府协商
we're coordinating with State

961
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,230
现在直升机会把你们送出城外
but for now the birds will drop you all outside the city

962
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,100
那边联络员佩德罗斯指挥官会等你们
where your POC is Commander Pedros

963
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,660
我稍后给你详细的路线信息

好了 我们接到新任务了 
Ok, we got the hill laming on the deck,

967
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,600
我们要去墨西哥南部和指挥官他们的小组汇合
we're gonna meet a Mexican South Commander and his team

968
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,180
他们会协助我们潜入目标地 
They're gonna help infiLTrate the target,

969
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,600
然后一同参与突击
and join us on the assault

970
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,800
你在开什么玩笑?
What the hell are you talking about?

971
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,130
我们还没将他们一网打尽 长官
We didn't got all of them yet, Chief

972
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,230
剩余的人在哪里?
Where's the rest of it?

973
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:30,910
他们在墨西卡利的边境
They're in Mexicali,  on the border

974
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:34,390
好吧 那其他人呢 他们怎么回船上?
All right, and the rest of the boys, how they getting back to the ship?

975
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:37,070
好人查理号会继续待命 他们会派陆战队过来
Bon Homme Richard stayed on station, they're gonna send them Marine helmet

976
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,480
进行扫尾工作 
head all back split to target, and when they're done,

977
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,790
完事后我们的人会和他们一起撤离
the boys will pull off with them

978
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:40,400
好的
Ok

979
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,350
我在想
I'm thinking

980
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,380
让第一小队跟我走
squad 1 and myself roll out

981
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:44,690
好的 第二小队呆在这里 
Perfect, squad 2 stay here,

982
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,190
和陆战队一起撤离
buttons up, pulls out of the marines

983
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,110
好的
Ok

984
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,490
但现在 在日出之前
But now we would go to put them to town

985
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,920
我们得把他们安置在镇上
and crushing the sunrise

986
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,050
另一组会在几天内到达德克萨斯
Gather group we're gonna take as following day, the wadis

987
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,040
我明白
comprendors

988
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,290
长官 谁命令我们去墨西卡利的执行任务?
Hey sir, who the hell clear us had to go to Mexicali anyway?

989
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:22,700
我们所有行动上头都一清二楚 
this would do all that we up to the platform.

990
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,310
州政府部门决定的
States Department on it.

991
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,990
美国和墨西哥边境
Border Wall with Mexico

992
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,420
长官
Hey Sir

993
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:05,670
开启第二频道
channel 2

994
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:15,560
如果我们这样下去 会累死街头的
By this time on keep work like this, Jacky's gonna be squeezed and kicked out on road

995
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,820
如论如何 要是我们把任务快速搞定 
however, if we had this target quick enough,

996
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,250
你就能穿越地道早点回家了
he jump on the burrow right at shit home

997
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,570
嘿 我可不用走地道回家
Hey, I gonna need no burrow

998
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,670
你请到两周的假期了吗
you got it two weeks

999
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,530
在飞机上打电话的时候
on the time I was there on the plane hall

1000
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,280
对我回家的问题你可是犹豫不决啊
you were not convinced so let me go home,

1001
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,940
但我现在很肯定的告诉你来负责这次行动吧
but I'm convinced gonna leave your ass in charge

1002
01:19:56,030 --> 01:20:00,230
墨西卡利 美国/墨西哥边境
MEXICALI,
US/MEXICO BORDER

1003
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,140
长官
Sir

1004
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,220
中尉
Lieutenant

1005
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,020
看起来政府正在忙着和墨方面协调呢 是吧?
Seems our government have been very busy to make this possible, huh?

1006
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:48,610
据说很困难
All the way the tough, from I heard

1007
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,540
有些事情你必须明白
There is something that you have to understand

1008
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,710
我的上司 
my superiors,

1009
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:54,510
他们害怕事态演变成墨版的摩加迪沙事件
they're very fearful of Mexican "mogadishu"

1010
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,020
他们重点强调了 不要重演黑鹰坠落的悲剧
no black hawk down, that's what they're saying, so

1011
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,620
我们行动要尽量低调
we do need to stay under the radar

1012
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,020
我完全明白 长官
I understand completely Sir.

1013
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,480
你的小队能过来支援我感激万分
Your team presence here is greatly appreciated

1014
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,400
但是时间紧迫 我们得开始行动了
But we're out of time, we need to move

1015
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,420
告诉我 我们该去哪儿
Tell me where  we go

1016
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:07,080
帮你把信息整理一下 
Help piece these together for me.

1017
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,240
情报表示他们在利用地道网
Our intel says they using a tunnel network,

1018
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,760
但在一家牛奶厂房的下面
but it's under a milk factory

1019
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,140
这些信息对你有帮助吗?
This mean anything to you?

1020
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,250
我知道确切位置
I know exactly where it is

1021
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,140
离这里不远
It's not far from here

1022
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:17,420
那就是我们要去的地方
And that's where we going

1023
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:21,570
墨西卡利大概没有比这环境更恶劣的地方了
From all of the places of Mexicali you could have been, this probably the worst

1024
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,830
贩毒团伙几乎全方位部署了那个地区
The cartels control any of that from all the angles

1025
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,680
他们的火力远远胜过我们 
They had us heavily outgunned.

1026
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,830
单是接近目标就很是困难
Simply reaching your target's gonna be very difficult

1027
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,460
长官 我们的国家正面临威胁
Sir we have a thorn national's heading to our country

1028
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,070
毋庸置疑 他们可不待见我们
needless to say, they're no big fan of ours

1029
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,630
要是他们就在那个工厂里 
If they are in that factory,

1030
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:35,460
那就是我们的目的地
that's where we going

1031
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,400
中尉 我会带你们到你们需要去的任何地方
Lieutenant, I'll take you anywhere you need to go

1032
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,610
但你和你的战友们得做好打场恶仗的心理准备
But prepare your men for a bigger fight than you had imagine

1033
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,200
你不但要和目标作战
You're not fighting at men

1034
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,080
还要和那些保护目标的毒枭们火拼
you're also fighting the cartels that protecting them.

1035
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,610
要是你们的目标成功进入了地下通道 
If your targets make it into those tunnels,

1036
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:48,310
那就无以遁形了
they'll disappear like ghosts

1037
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,780
你从这里进入隧道
You enter the tunnels right here

1038
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:34,940
走几米后会到达岔口
You walk several miles to this fork

1039
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:37,260
我的人会告诉你走那条路
my men will tell you which way to take

1040
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,400
一旦你们到达指定地点
Once you get to this point

1041
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,320
我的工作就结束了
My job is done

1042
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:43,350
你们就只能靠自己了
You're on your own

1043
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:14,240
中尉 我们现在就出发吧
Lieutenant, we're going now

1044
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,510
收到
Roger that

1045
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:40,760
长官 不要停下 我们身负重任
Chief, We'll not stopping, we'll rolling up on target hard

1046
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,490
收到 预计30秒后到达
Roger that, should've there about 30 seconds up

1047
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,590
屋顶有人!
SA, on the roof!

1048
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:50,460
我们得快撤
We gotta go

1049
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:51,510
快!
Now!

1050
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:10,160
快走
Let's go

1051
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,530
你留在这里
You stay here

1052
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,250
长官 留两个人在这里看守
Sir, leave two men here

1053
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,600
你们俩 留在这!
You two, stay here!

1054
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,230
准备好 他们来了
Get ready, they're coming

1055
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,460
威米!
Weimy!

1056
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,960
威米!
Weimy!

1057
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,620
我需要你控制住这该死的家伙的火力
I need you to lock this shit down

1058
