00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,790
- 身价直逼10亿  - 真的是"10亿"?

在这里 他们都对他十分忠诚
They are extremely loyal to him over here.

86
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,180
美国缉毒局什么时候把他移交给我们?

他坚持驾驶飞机很久 使得每个人都有足够的时间跳下去
He kept the Liberator aloft just long enough for everyone to jump,

96
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,420
之后随着飞机一起坠毁了
and then he went down with the plane.

97
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,630
你身体里也流淌着他英勇的血液

105
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,280
但这跟待在斯塔顿岛可不一样

106
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,410
要想学会冲浪 你可要非常地努力
You got to actually work hard to get through the surf.

特库姆塞曾说过 "一根筷子易折断

一捆筷子力量坚"

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,210
嗯...
Hm...

134

一旦我们决定出发 上飞机执行海外派遣任务
Once we step off on campaign, once this bird's ready and we're downrange,

我是说 如果家里遇到了危机

出现了资金问题或者其它什么的
things aren't right with the finances or something's off,

208
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,080
都会让我们分心的 所以在我们出发之前 一定要先说清楚
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we need to have that tight before we launch.

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,080
如果有人有问题 就提出来

287
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,650
阿拉万岁
Allahu Akbar.

288
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,900
阿布・沙宝是车臣恐怖分子
Abu Shabal is a Chechen terrorist

289
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,400
曾参与了别斯兰人质事件
who's associated with the Beslan School Massacre.

290
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,580
他一直周转于印度尼西亚和菲律宾的集训营
He's been jumping between training camps in Indonesia and the Philippines.

291
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,250
虽然现在我们队克里斯托和阿布・沙宝之间的联系不是很清楚
Now, the connection between Christo and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,

292
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,080
但如果莫拉莱斯一直在调查这些
but if this was the lead that Morales was working on,

293
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,670
这也就是她被绑架的原因 有补充的吗 长官?
it could be why she was abducted. Senior?

294
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,550
好了 此次是对进行莫拉莱斯小姐的救援行动
All right, this is a personnel recovery of Miss Morales.

295
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,340
好了 有问题吗?
All right, who's got questions?

296
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,760
长官 有营地内部人员数目
Senior Chief, you got any updated source intel

297
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,600
包括巡逻队的最新资料吗?
on numbers inside the camp, and what about roving patrols?

298
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,680
大概有8到10个人 兄弟 但对于巡逻队 我们毫不知情
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't know anything about roving patrols.

299
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,520
所以你要当成他们就在外面巡逻
You're just gonna have to assume that they're out there

300
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,770
整装待发 他们也是以此为生的
walking around, squared away. They do this for a living, too.

301
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,270
长官 目标人员所持有的武器如何?
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target are we looking at?

302
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,570
他们持有重武器 这些家伙都是毒枭
Heavy weapons. These guys are narco-traffickers,

303
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,822
任何苏制德什卡重武器 他们都可能有
so they can have anything from Soviet-bloc DShks.

304
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,742
可能持有M2HP以及.5口径的突击步枪 我们没有确切情报
They could have M2HP, .50-cals out there, we don't know.

305
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,037
那里很可能会有军火库 所以我建议你们带上火箭筒
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.

306
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,749
注意一点 火箭会烧着附近的植物 因此你们必须确保一次就命中目标
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match, so make sure you got a clear shot.

307
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,586
- 好的 还有什么问题?  - 人质还有行动能力吗?
- All right, what else?  - Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?

308
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,296
现场血迹斑斑
There was a ton of blood on the scene,

309
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,882
我们的人已经确认过 那些主要是罗斯先生的血迹
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross', we confirmed that.

310
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,093
还有一部分可能是莫拉莱斯女士的 这些人是禽兽
Miss Morales may have bled there, too, but these guys are savages,

311
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,804
暂且假定人质已没有行动能力
so you're gonna have to assume that she is non-ambulatory,

312
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,265
所以你们得带上抬她出来的家伙
so you're gonna have to bring stuff to carry her out.

313
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,812
跳伞倒计时两分钟
Two minutes to drop.

314
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,619
嘿 中尉
Hey, LT.

315
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,997
你得告诉我们那个家伙是谁 咱们回来之后就帮你去教训他
You got to let us know who that guy is, so when we get back, we can kick his ass.

316
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,041
那个家伙?
What guy?

317
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,710
把你发型整得跟狗啃似的那个
The guy that gave you that fucked-up haircut.

318
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,048
- 滚  - 你真可恶 索尼
- Fuck.  - Damn, Sonny,

319
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,301
什么时候轮到你来评论了啊 你的也不怎么样 看起来跟多明尼亚人似的
you should be the last guy to talk. You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.

320
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,471
那只能说明我的头跟你的金牙一样亮晶晶的 对吧?
That means my head shines like your gold teeth, huh?

321
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,765
别这样说
Don't be like that,

322
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,766
- 你太损了  - 打开滑行台!
- that's harsh.  - Ramp!

324
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,819
伙计 跟你说吧 当一个准爸爸是唯一值得欣慰的事
Man, I tell you what. The only thing better than this right here is being a dad,

325
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,488
除了换尿布那种事 但...
except for that whole changing diaper thing, but...

326
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,740
山迪会帮我搞定的 所以...
Sandy does that for me anyway, so...

327
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,701
我还是挺激动的
I'm actually looking forward to it.

00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,147
别睡过去
Stay with us.

426
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,192
坚持 麦克 醒醒 醒醒 坚持下去 伙计
Come on, Mike. Wake up. Wake up. Come on, man.

427
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,448
- 交火!  - 战斗 继续战斗
- Contact!  - Pick it up, pick it up.

428
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,075
嗨 长官 我们能到补给点!
Yo, Chief! We can make it to rally point!

429
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,537
- 就这样! 通知中尉!  - 坚持啊 伙计
- Sounds good! Pass it to LT!  - Come on, man.

430
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,542
中尉 中尉 我们是行动队 我们不能到达第二撤离点了
LT, LT, this is assault team. We just lost the secondary extract.

431
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,128
重复 我们到不了第二撤离点了
I say again, we just lost secondary extract.

432
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,838
我们正向补给点前进 听到请回复 完毕?
Moving to rally point. How copy, over?

433
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,927
- 我们离那还有1千米  - 麦克 醒醒
- We're about a click out.  - Mikey, wake up.

434
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,887
还有一千米!
One click out!

435
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,897
快点 麦克 醒醒 坚持住 伙计
Let's go, Mike. Wake up. Come on, buddy.

436
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,483
坚持下去 麦克! 醒醒!
Come on, Mikey! Wake up!

437
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,081
- 准备好了吗?  - 后方安全
- Good?  - Backstage clear.

438
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,917
发射!
Rocket out!

439
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,643
他没呼吸了!
He's not breathing!

440
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,603
- 呼吸啊 麦克!  - 我们上车了! 出发!
- Breathe, Mikey!  - We're up! We're up!

441
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,110
队长 把你的M4给我!
Chief, let me get your M-4!

442
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,697
长官 那些船有什么标识?
Sir, what's the status on those boats?

443
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,573
我跟战鞭分队失去联系了
I lost Whiplash on the run.

444
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,660
已经告诉他们你提前打击了目标 他们现在正猛烈反扑
Told 'em you hit the target early. They're coming in hot.

445
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,871
- 收到  - 该死! 喝啊 伙计
- Roger that.  - Fuck! Take this, man.

446
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,206
呼吸 坚持啊 米奇
Breathe, Mikey. Come on, Mikey.

447
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,417
- 他没脉搏了  - 后方交火!
- I got no pulse.  - Contact rear!

448
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,584
后方交火!
Contact rear!

449
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,838
该死!
Holy shit!

450
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,006
把好方向盘...
Taking rounds in...

451
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,219
开枪 战斗
Pick it up. Pick it up.

452
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,956
阿杰! 快速反应部队快要追上来了!
Ajay! QRF coming up the rear!

453
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,215
战鞭! 战鞭! 第二撤离点已暴露
Whiplash! Whiplash! Secondary extract is burnt.

454
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,051
直接去第三撤离点
Moving to tertiary extract.

455
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,137
这儿共有8人 七名士兵 一名人质
I have eight packs, seven Sierras, one package.

456
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,555
人质身上多处负伤
Package with multiple wounds.

457
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,141
一名士兵头部中枪
The Sierra has gunshot wound to the head.

458
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,393
形势很危急
This will be a hot extract.

459
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,151
出了什么事?!
What the fuck?!

460
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,903
- 哦 该死!  - 麦克 躺好!
- Oh, shit!  - Mikey, stay down!

461
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,155
- 让他趴下 伙计!  - 我这他妈的是在哪儿?!
- Keep him down, man!  - Where the fuck am I?!

462
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,075
- 冷静点 兄弟  - 麦克醒了 哥们 麦克醒了
- Calm down, brother.  - Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.

463
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,203
躺好 兄弟 冷静点 没事儿的 我们就要到安全的地方了
Stay down, brother. Calm. Be easy. We're almost out of here.

464
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,454
我们就要到安全的地方了
We're almost out of here.

465
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,557
麦克!
Mikey!

466
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,184
- 坚持 伙计  - 我们在哪儿?
- Hang on, buddy.  - Where are we?

467
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,061
- 我们正赶往撤离点  - 发生什么了?
- We're on our way to extract.  - What happened?

468
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,854
你会没事的 你头部中了一枪 伙计
You're good to go. You took one to the face, man.

469
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,106
你的命真他妈硬
You're a hard motherfucker.

470
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,399
- 人质救出来了吗?  - 是的
- Did we get her?  - Yes.

471
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,858
- 哦 天呐  - 我们正赶往撤离点呢
- Oh, my God.  - We're on our way to extract.

472
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,403
阿杰 有水 有水
Ajay, splash it. Splash it.

473
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,656
前方遇水! 前方遇水!
Water! Water! Water!

474
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,661
来啦! 来啦!
Going in! Going in!

475
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,705
我抓稳她了! 抓稳了!
I got her! I got her!

476
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,998
车在下沉
It's fucking going under.

477
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,834
出去! 快出去!
Out! Get the fuck out!

478
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,014
我们并非一无所获
It wasn't for nothing.

479
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:06,814
乌克兰 北纬50°27' 东经30°30’

480
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,814
有什么事?

481
00:43:48,303 --> 00:43:50,214
是门德尔松的作品吗?

482
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:55,214
不 是 勃拉姆斯的

483
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,214
克里姆是哪位?

484
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,214
你一定是沙宝?

485
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,900
我跟克里斯托在电话中谈过

486
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,520
我有你想要的东西

487
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,980
很轻吧?

488
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,210
你可以穿在晚礼服里面

489
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,500
里面装满了瓷制弹珠

490
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,770
有五百多个

491
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,100
弹珠被编进衬衫里

492
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,120
再填装一种新型的爆炸性凝胶

493
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,030
杀伤力巨大

494
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,390
看这个

495
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,950
我知道 这个看起来杀伤力不怎么大

496
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,990
但这是专为公共场合设计的

497
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,110
相信我 这世上没有任何一种单人操纵的武器

498
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,890
能在杀伤力上跟它相媲美

499
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:05,670
瞧

500
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,410
没有比这个更安全的了

501
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,290
你穿着这件衣服进出白宫都不会被发现

502
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,250
你能示范一下吗?

503
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,620
你有时间开车去西伯利亚吗?

504
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,000
这个爆炸的话... 没人能幸免

505
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,020
想象一下 随着剧烈的爆炸...

506
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,100
500发子弹朝着四面八方射出

507
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,230
要是穿一件去像那样的体育馆

508
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,390
一个赌场 或是购物中心 

509
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,720
你绝对会造成媒体恐慌...

510
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,530
你就达成目的了... 经济会完全崩溃

511
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,660
孩子 瞧你

512
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,900
风采依旧啊

513
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,760
要帮您拿大衣吗?

514
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,320
不用了 谢谢

515
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,242
要知道 我总会时不时的
You know, from time to time,

516
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,205
去看看我以前的那些老朋友
I get to see my old friends from my old life.

517
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,083
但他们总是让我失望
And it's always, always disappointing.

518
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,130
一些成为了混蛋 其他的让人厌烦
Some become assholes, other boring,

519
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,300
真不敢相信 以前我竟然会花大把精力去哄骗她们上床
and I can't believe I tried to get them in bed all those years ago.

520
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,431
嘿
Hey.

521
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,850
但你从没让我失望过 尤里
It is nice not to be disappointed, Yuri.

522
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,732
- 我的名字不叫尤里  - 我知道
- That's not my name.  - I know.

523
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,236
默罕默德・阿布・沙宝 沙宝家族的后裔
Mohammed Abu Shabal, the son of Shabal.

524
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,197
得了 你的父亲名字可是尤维基尼
Come on. Your father's name is Yevgeny.

525
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,574
时代变了
Things change.

526
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,202
是啊 时代变了
Yeah, things have changed.

527
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,623
这就是为什么 这是咱俩最后一次见面的原因了
That's why this is the last time we might have to see each other for quite some time.

528
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,918
我现在真想找个地方躲会儿
For I might have to find a hole to hide in.

529
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,506
我不太明白
I don't understand.

530
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,594
我被中情局监控了 我不想冒险
I'm being watched by the CIA, and I'm not taking any chances.

531
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,431
只要一有机会 我就会带我的家人去南部
As soon as the opportunity presents itself, I'm taking my family south.

532
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,767
我没有能力也没精力去跟美国人斗了
I neither have the energy or the will to fight the Americans.

533
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,603
那我们的交易怎么办 米哈伊尔?
What about our deal, Mikhail?

534
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,189
我的人已经训练了将近一年了
My men have been training for almost a year now.

535
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,317
- 我倾家荡产去...  - 交易还成立 尤里
- I have devoted much of my resources...  - The deal stands, Yuri.

536
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,653
我提前退休并不意味着
Just because I've taken early retirement does not mean

537
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,113
咱们之间的交易就此中断
I'm not holding up my end of the bargain.

538
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,281
还有很多事需要做
There is so much to be done.

539
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,200
没我 你们也一样能成
And it will be, just without me.

540
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,910
你还可以跟我信任的伙伴合作
You'll have to use my trusted associates.

541
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,787
我也不这样想
That's not so good for me.

542
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,205
- 嘿...  - 嘿! 闭嘴!
- Hey...  - Hey! Shut up!

543
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,040
闭上你的臭嘴!
Shut up!

544
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,585
别在这扯淡了!
Stop your fucking bullshit!

545
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,546
那怎么行 行不通的 你不能半路撂挑子
It's not good. Doesn't work. You can't change it like that.

546
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,549
- 什么都没变  - 你还有脸说什么都没变
- Nothing changes. Nothing.  - You just told me everything's changed.

547
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,426
那... 你这算怎么回事? 你说啊?
What... what is that? What is that?

548
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,469
你知道我费了多大劲才走到今天这地步?!
Do you know what I do to get here?!

549
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,097
你知道我牺牲了多少手下吗?!
Do you know the men who I've had to sacrifice to get here?!

550
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,558
你知道吗?!
Do you have any idea?!

551
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,810
你知道个屁! 你就知道自己享受纸醉金迷的生活!
No, you shit! You live up here in this ivory tower!

552
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,979
你不... 对别人你一点都不在乎!
You have no... you don't care!

553
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,748
美国中央海岸 北纬12°9’ 西经86°16’

554
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,333
嘿 队长 麦克怎么样了?
Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?

555
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,046
他的眼睛是保不住了 但他... 能活下去
He's definitely gonna lose the eye, but he's... he's hanging tough.

556
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,674
嘿 我必须得说
Hey, I'm gonna get reed this.

557
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,344
干得好 教训了那些家伙 把莫拉莱斯救了回来
Greatjob smoke-checking those assholes and getting Morales back.

558
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,513
虽然麦克负伤了 但我还是得说 干得真不错
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but I gotta tell you what, that was solid work.

559
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,682
队长 你得马上把消息传达给你的弟兄
So, Chief, you make sure you get that down to the boys right away.

560
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,017
- 听清了吗?  - 明白
- You hear me?  - Check.

561
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,979
好了 再说说莫拉莱斯 她可真是坚强
All right. Now, Morales, Morales was one tough chick,

562
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,482
但她本该早点汇报这些情况的
but she should've gotten the stuff up the chain a lot faster

563
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,817
这件事比我们预想的要严重得多
because this thing is way bigger than we thought it was.

564
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,237
怎么回事? 我以为这只是一次美国公民的营救任务
How is that? I thought this was a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.

565
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,824
在你们捡到那部手机之前的确如此
Yeah, it was until we got into that phone that you guys picked up in that shithole.

566
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,619
那让我意识到事情根本没那么简单
It turned me on to something that just does not look right at all.

567
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,705
- 那到底哪里不对呢?  - 克里斯托和沙宝的关系比我们想像的
- And what's not right about it?  - Christo and Shabal are a lot closer

568
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,541
要密切得多 沙宝只是个棋子而已 伙计
than I thought they were, and Shabal is a wild card, man.

569
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,420
他虽是个老派基地分子 根本不在乎钱和毒品
He is an old-school jihadi that couldn't give a rat's ass about money or drugs.

570
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,714
是的 那他童年的朋友克里斯托是毒贩子吗?
Yeah, and his childhood friend, Christo, the dope dealer?

571
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,259
他不是个毒枭 而是走私犯
He is not a dealer, man. He's a smuggler.

572
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,721
- 你在开玩笑吧  - 我也希望是这样
- You have got to be kidding me.  - That is exactly what I'm thinking.

573
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,556
沙宝想袭击美国人
Shabal wants to kill Americans.

574
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,893
克里斯托知道怎么把他弄进美国
Christo knows how to get fuckers inside America.

575
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,354
在中国这可是严重的问题 伙计们
This could be big trouble in little China, fellas.

576
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,022
他们想在美国本土袭击我们
They're gonna hit us at home.

577
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,527
我刚跟上司和特别行动小组谈过了
I just got done talking to the boss and the Spec Ops Task Force,

578
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,028
这就是我们的计划
and this is what's gonna go down.

579
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,948
我要瑞和阿杰待命 两小时后执行一项特种侦察任务
I need Ajay and Ray standing by to launch for an SR in two hours.

580
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,409
一路飞到非洲 他俩又可以积攒很多飞行里程数了
They're gonna get some frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.

581
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,952
为什么去非洲?
Why Africa?

582
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,413
根据你找到的手机 我们在那地方发现了一个飞机场
We pinned an airfield there with that phone that you got,

583
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,425
我认为沙宝会在那里
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there

584
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,625
完成武器交易然后西进
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.

585
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,378
你说的西进 是什么意思 去墨西哥的西面?
When you say "west," what are we talking about, Mexico west?

586
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,882
算是吧 墨西哥西面 那是最坏的情况了
Yeah, Mexico west. That's worst-case scenario.

587
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,968
你们和排里剩下的人在这里待命
You two and the rest of the platoon are gonna stay here on standby.

588
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,688
万一美国国土附近出了什么岔子
You'll be the primary assault force

589
00:50:15,736 --> 00:50:17,388
你们就是主要的突击力量了
in case something goes down anywhere near America.

590
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,348
- 明白  - 明白
- Check.  - Check.

591
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,475
如果有什么情况要向你汇报的话 你还会在这里吗?
You gonna be around for any questions as they come up?

592
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:25,938
才不呢 克里斯托...这家伙好好的戏弄了咱们一番 现在又消失了
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman Polanski on my ass and disappeared.

593
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,940
所以我要联系第四海豹突击队
So I'm gonna link up with SEAL Team Four,

594
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,317
在南太平洋上把他打得满地找牙
and we're gonna go hunt his ass down in the South Pacific.

595
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,945
那我就去享受鸡尾酒和棕榈树啦
So it's straight up Mai Tais and palm trees for me, baby.

596
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,071
没问题 伙计 手到擒来啊
Yeah, brother. Go get him.

597
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,448
- 没问题的  - 小心点
- You be cool. - Take it easy.

598
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,616
恭喜你要当爸爸了 中尉
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.

599
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,121
- 大伙都知道了吗?  - 只有重要的人才知道
- Does everybody know?  - Only the important people.

600
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,665
对谁重要的人? 对你来说的?
The important people to who? You?

601
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,460
算是吧
I guess so.

602
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,588
- 我去跟兄弟们大概说下任务  - 嘿 等一下
- I'm gonna go brief the boys. - Hey, hold on one second.

603
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,216
老兄 我之前从来没写过这东西
Hey, brother, I've never written one of these before.

604
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,054
嘿 我是跟着你干的 长官
Hey, I'm tracking with you, Sir. I am.

605
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,805
但老实跟你说
But, to be honest with you,

606
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,225
我之前在考虑打给指挥部 希望能让回家
I was thinking of calling the command and trying to get you home.

607
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:08,147
但这会儿要做的事情这么多 我觉得我们真的很需要你
But now that work's picked up so much, I feel like we really need you here.

608
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,025
你记得我们上次在安巴尔的那次任务吗?
You remember our last cruise to Al Anbar?

609
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,027
- 记得啊  - 你在施行最后清剿的时候
- Yeah.  - When you had that final turnover op,

610
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,613
你说我可以去
and you said I didn't need to be there?

611
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,441
当时我就躺在床上
I was laying in bed and

612
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:19,241
我意识到我唯一要做的事情就是回家去
I realized the only thing I needed to do now was go home.

613
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,078
但如果你的任务有个闪失
But if something went south on your op,

614
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,371
我肯定会抱憾终身的
I would always regret not being there with you.

谢谢你一直以来的照顾  戴夫
I appreciate you taking care of me big-time, Dave,

616
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,834
我一直很上头在商量
but I'm working some things with the brass.

617
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,880
如果可以的话 等事态缓解了 我就放自己两周的假
If I can, and things slow down, I'm gonna get two weeks off.

618
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,175
不管怎么说 我都希望这事能早点解决 真的
Well, I hope it works out either way. I really do.

619
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,553
但万一出事的话 我就把这张纸
But, if it doesn't, I'm gonna take this piece of paper,

620
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,514
叠成一架纸飞机 然后飞出去了

01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,376
不好意思 我都不知道你是哪位
I'm sorry. I don't know your name.

711
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,585
- 我叫奥托  - 奥托 你好

712
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,462
- 好 那你是?  - 很高兴见到你

713
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:58,672
我叫克里斯托
Christo.

714
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,590
- 叫克里斯科?  - 是克里斯托
- Crisco? - Christo.

715
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,510
特拉伊卡维奇?
Troskawicz?

716
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,637
话说 我到底要纠缠你到何时
So how long am I gonna need to keep busting your balls

717
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,931
才能得到一块那样的标志啊?
about getting one of those patches?

718
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,350
哦 这个啊 我觉得不会再发了
Ah, yeah, I think it was, like, a one-time deal, man.

719
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,353
911之后 我叔叔给排里送了一批
After 9/11, my uncle sent a bunch out for the platoon,

720
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,481
这次行动完了之后 我把这个送给你好了
but, uh, after this go-round, I'll give it to you.

721
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,483
不用 不用 我才不会拿你们的家徽的
No, no, I'm not gonna take your family crest.

722
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,153
好极了 反正我也没真心打算给你
All right, good. I didn't want to give it to you anyway.

723
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,155
而且 我确定我看到你
Besides, man, I'm pretty sure I saw you

724
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,240
那天往大口袋里放了些东西的
putting something in your cargo pocket the other day.

725
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:29,035
- 怎么说?  - 我那天看到
- What's that?  - I know I've seen you carrying

726
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,912
你那边口袋有什么东西的
something in that pocket right there.

727
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,540
是什么东西?
What is it?

728
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,001
那是我祖父的旗帜(盖在棺材上的旗帜)
That's my grandfather's flag.

729
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,753
我爸爸把它传给了我
My pop gave it to me,

730
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,546
以后我要继续传给我的儿子
and now I'm gonna give it to my boy someday.

731
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,715
好的 这传统我喜欢
All right. I like that.

732
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,185
你的船不错的样子啊
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.

733
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,519
- 这船简直是好极了  - 谢谢
- It's fabulous.  - Thank you. Yes.

734
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,980
- 我叫它 星舰船  - 星舰船
- I believe it's called "Starship".  - "Starship."

735
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,482
我喜欢你说星舰船的样子
I Iove the way you say Starship.

736
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,151
像极了俄罗斯人 那个.... 星际迷航里的那个人
It's Iike Russian. That guy, uh... "Star Trek".

737
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,403
叫什么来着 斯科蒂? 哦 不对 叫斯科特
What's his name, Scotty? Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.

738
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,906
- 我怎么会知道  - 好吧 你从来没看过星际迷航?
- I wouldn't know.  - Yes. You've never seen Star Trek?

739
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,741
- 没看过  - 哦 这没道理啊
- No.  - Oh, that's insane.

740
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,367
伙计 你的问题就在这里
So here's the problem, pal.

741
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,578
你值很多钱
You're worth a lot of money.

742
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,915
- 或者你之前值很多钱  - 我相信现在我也值很多钱
- Or you were worth a lot of money.  - I believe I still am.

743
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,208
- 是吗?  - 是的
- You do?  - Yes.

744
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:20,086
好吧 就让我来告诉你 这世道的规矩是怎么样的吧 克里斯科
All right. Let me tell you how the world works there, Crisco.

745
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,797
- 是叫克里斯托  - 再说一遍?
- It's Christo. - Sorry?

746
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,590
- 是克里斯托  - 哦 不好意思
- Christo.  - Oh, of course. Sorry.

747
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,008
没事
It's OK.

748
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,551
我来告诉你这世道是怎么样的吧
Let me tell you how the world really works.

749
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,928
- 说吧  - 这船已经不是你的了
- Please.  - This is no longer your boat.

750
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,223
从我走进来那刻起 你就不是之前那个你了
Since I walked through that door, you're not the same guy you used to be.

751
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,601
就是这样 我也没办法阻止这一切
You're just not. There's nothing I can do to stop that,

752
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:37,729
除非你让我帮你 不让我也没法帮你
nothing I can do to help you right now, unless you let me help you.

753
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,441
你和我之间 我们需要同心协力 伙计
We need to do this together, pal. You and me.

754
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,320
那你和那些圣战分子搞在一起感觉怎么样啊?
So how is it that you're working with these jihadi folks, then?

755
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,073
你是犹太人 没错吧?
You're Jewish, right?

756
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,244
沙宝是谁?
Shabal is what?

757
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,457
- 你有从小穿裤裆的伙伴吗?  - 你说什么?
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?  - Sorry?

758
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,501
你有那种从小一起长大的伙伴吗?
Have you ever had a friend that you grew up with?

759
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,878
- 有啊  - 有共同爱好的 踢足球啊
- Yes.  - Had, like, played interests, played soccer,

760
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,880
或者... 你们是玩什么? 可能是棒球 对吧?
or... What would you play? Baseball, probably, right?

761
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,549
- 算是吧 好吧  - 好吧
- Probably. Yeah. - Yeah.

762
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,050
之后你们分道扬镳
And then you went on your separate ways,

763
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:10,011
然后几年之前 你又再聚首
and then some years later, you meet up.

764
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,598
但你完全认不出那个人了
And you totally didn't recognize the person.

765
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,767
沙宝就是这么个情况
And that's what happened with Shabal.

766
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,562
我们志向相同
We share a common interest.

767
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:22,941
他就着他的信仰 想出了这个惊人的主意
So he came up with this incredible idea because of his beliefs.

768
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:27,404
我虽然和他有不同的信仰 但他可是个聪明人
I don't necessarily share his beliefs, but he's a smart guy.

769
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,573
就好像是...
You know, it's almost like...

770
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,324
就好像是...
you know, it's almost Iike...

771
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,617
这个就好像是我
like this is me.

772
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,084
- 而那个就是沙宝  - 是吗?
- And that's Shabal.  - Is it?

773
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,211
- 美国就夹在中间  - 是吗?
- And America is in-between.  - Is it?

774
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,421
没错
Yeah.

775
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,215
这比喻不错吧?
Cool concept, no?

776
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,884
- 夹在中间?  - 是的
- Right here?  - Yes.

777
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,387
你以为这是场游戏吗?
You think this is some kind of game?

778
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,850
问你呢? 你觉得这样很有意思吗?
Do you? Do you find this amusing?

779
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,977
- 我没觉得...  - 你知道你在做什么吗?
- I'm not finding...  - Do you realize what you're doing here?

780
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,188
黑胡子小队 这里是黑胡子总部
Blackbeard Actual, Blackbeard Main.

781
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,691
通过全体队员 B目标已清除
Post nation counterpart. Secured target Bravo.

782
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,986
三号船报告 你们可安全前往A目标
Report to Tri-Hull. You're clear to move on target Alpha.

783
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,822
收到 总部 占领目标
Roger, Main. Clear to target.

784
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,412
我需要交代的人 就只有我家里人
The only people I answer to is my family.

785
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,831
我妻子和我孩子
To my wife and to my child.

786
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,083
没其他人的事
And nobody else.

787
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,378
- 赶时间啊?  - 废话太多了
- Running late somewhere? - Shit filter's full.

788
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:26,713
- 是吗?  - 没错
- Really?  - Yeah.

789
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:30,300
伙计 那现在情况是这样的
So here's the problem, pal.

790
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,302
你在乎你家里人 对吧?
You do love your family, don't you?

791
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,555
- 是的  - 那在乎你女儿不?
- Yes, I do.  - And what about your daughter?

792
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,140
我女儿怎么了?
What about my daughter?

793
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,142
你还想再见到她吗?
Are you looking forward to seeing her again?

794
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,977
就没有不想过
Every minute of my life.

795
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:04,993
我给你看这个
I wanted you to see that

796
01:06:05,034 --> 01:06:08,213
是让你仔细考虑一下
so that you'd think about some things very seriously,

797
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,924
因为你马上就要被关起来
because you're gonna be sitting in a box somewhere.

798
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:14,886
得到合适的人性的对待
You'll be treated properly and humanely.

799
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:20,850
你女儿将会长大成人 嫁人生子
That girl is gonna grow up, and she's gonna get married,

800
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,229
你妻子也会另觅新欢
and your wife is gonna find someone else,

801
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,315
而你将会一无所有
and you're gonna miss everything.

802
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:37,951
如果因为我的所作所为威胁到我的家人
If I had done something that would endanger my family,

803
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,245
我肯定和你现在的感觉一样
I would feel just like you do right now.

804
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,041
你保证不害我家人?
You promise not to touch my family?

805
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,085
我永远不会害你的家人
I would never touch your family.

806
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,504
永远不会
I would not.

807
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,054
你听说过...
Are you familiar with...

808
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,975
陶瓷球背心吗?
ceramic ball bearings?

809
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,518
没听过
No.

810
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,896
那想象一下 16件装满
Just imagine 16 suicide vests

811
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,107
陶瓷弹珠的自杀背心
filled with those ceramic ball bearings,

812
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:13,778
逃过你们国家金属探测器和各处卡点的检查
slipping by every metal detector and every checkpoint in your country.

813
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,782
你一定觉得你们国家的经济将要完蛋了吧?
You think your economy is fucked now?

814
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:23,121
想想媒体会怎么大肆宣传这事吧 懂吗?
Just think what the media is gonna do with this. Hm?

815
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:26,624
到时候911事件候 看起来就像是在公园溜弯一样
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fucking walk in the park.

816
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,710
在中央花园溜个弯而已 简直弱爆了
The grand Central Park.

817
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,755
你是在说...
So you're telling me...

818
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:38,928
有16个穿自杀背心的圣战分子
there's 16 jihadis wearing suicide vests.

819
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:42,474
他们准备大摇大摆地入境
They're gonna walk right across the border.

820
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,143
那他们要去哪里?
So where are they going?

821
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,773
圣地亚哥 圣弗朗西斯科 休斯顿...
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...

822
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,649
城市随你选 他们随叫随到
You pick a city, they'll be there.

823
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:56,071
- 他们现在就开始行动了吗?  - 我们谈话的时候 就开始了
- And this is happening now? - It's happening as we speak.

824
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,323
不好意思 再说一遍?
Sorry, what?

825
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,910
我们谈话的时候 就开始了
It's happening as we speak.

826
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,206
你怎么样才能阻止这一切?
How can you stop this?

827
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,251
我也没办法
I can't.

828
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:14,751
墨西哥 塞德罗斯岛

829
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:03,615
黑胡子头儿 已经包围目标

是
Yeah.

854
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,682
幸好是个哑弹 要不然我就挂啦
Good thing that was a dud. I might've gotten hurt.

855
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,977
- 是啊  - 喔
- Yeah.  - Whoa.

856
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:28,606
天啊
Jesus.

857
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:35,196
这绝不是伊拉克小草屋里制作出来的劣质爆破马甲
This is not some bush-league vest from an Iraqi hut.

858
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,697
这是一些高速易爆物		
This is some high-speed shit.

859
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:40,576
那我还是先把这玩意放远一点吧?
Maybe we should put this somewhere else, huh?

860
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,711
嘿 索尼 把这个放别处 好吗?
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere to put this, would you?

861
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,304
目标安全 做好警戒工作
Target secure. Set security.

862
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,890
一个在北边守着 三个在南边守着
One's to the north, three south.

863
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:13,890
这就是你们的目标

864
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:33,890
嗯...

865
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:38,890
我为你们感到骄傲

866
01:16:44,472 --> 01:16:46,890
我们现在是一家人

867
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,395
嘿 长官 目标安排妥当了
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.

868
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,564
- 一切都安全  - 谢了 哥们儿
- Everything's secure.  - Thanks, man.

869
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,692
行动人员 任务还未完成 原地待命
Actual, mission not complete. Stand by for follow-on.

870
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,694
你们只击毙了一半的圣战主义恐怖分子
You only got half that jihadist cell.

871
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:00,031
- 目标安全了 长官  - 战斗还没结束
- The target's secure, sir.  - This fight isn't over yet.

872
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,034
现在 听着 另一半恐怖分子将会在早上7点的时候 
Now, Listen, the other half of that cell is gonna be crossing the border

873
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:06,537
利用墨西卡利的隧道网络 穿过边境
using a tunnel network from Mexicali at 0700.

874
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:09,248
我们现在正在跟国家协调 但是现在飞机会带你们
We're coordinating with State, but for now the birds will drop you off

875
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,710
到城市周边 在那儿你们的指挥官是佩德罗斯长官
outside the city where your POC is a Commander Pedros.

876
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,629
在路上的时候我会告诉你们细节
I'll give you more details en route.

877
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,922
- 行动人员 收到了吗?  - 报告总部 收到
- Actual, how do you copy?  - Roger, Main.

878
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:19,091
好了 直升机来接我们了
OK, we've got a helo landing on the deck,

879
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,385
我们要去跟墨西哥特种部队指挥官和他的小队汇合
we're gonna meet a Mexican SOF commander and his team.

880
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:24,388
他们将帮助我们找到目标 一起发起攻击
They're gonna help infil us to the target and join us on the assault.

881
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,767
- 你说这话什么意思?  - 还有些余孽没清除 长官
- What the hell are you talking about?  - We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

882
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:31,020
- 那剩下的在哪儿?  - 在墨西卡利的边境
- And where's the rest of 'em?  - They're in Mexicali on the border.

883
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,813
好 那剩下的战友
All right. And the rest of the boys,

884
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,106
他们怎么回到船上?
how are they getting back to the ship?

885
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:35,566
本.欧姆.理查德继续留在驻地
Bon Homme Richard stayed on station.

886
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,652
他们会派名海军陆战队员来盘问目标
They're gonna send in a Marine element to help exploit the target.

887
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,071
完成后 剩下的战友跟他们一起撤退
When they're done, the boys will pull off with them.

888
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:43,157
好 那我和一队先去
OK. I'm thinking Squad One and myself roll out.

889
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,034
很好 二队先留在这儿准备善后
Perfect. Squad Two stays here, buttons it up,

890
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,952
- 再跟海军一起撤离  - 好的
- pulls out with the Marines.  - OK.

891
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,169
我们往北走
We're moving north of here through town,

892
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,921
日出之前穿过市中心
and crossing at sunrise.

893
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,840
另一组第二天会穿过华瑞兹市(墨西哥城市)
The other group will get into Texas the following day,

894
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,425
到达德克萨斯州
through Juarez.

895
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,220
明白了吗?
Comprendes?

896
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:20,069
嘿 长官! 谁他妈的让咱们这么匆忙的赶去墨西卡利?
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared us hot to go to Mexicali anyway?

897
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,446
这人可大有来头啊
This one's going all the way up the flagpole.

898
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,240
国务院下的命令
State Department's on it.

899
01:18:34,614 --> 01:18:36,240
美国与墨西哥边境墙

900
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,823
嘿 长官 频道二
Hey, sir. Channel two.

901
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,621
嘿 以这个速度
Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,

902
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:15,332
杰基就得自己在家生孩子了
Jackie's gonna be squeezing that kid out on her own.

903
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:20,921
但是 如果我们速度搞定这个任务 你就可以骑个小毛驴赶回家了
However, we hit this target quick enough, you jump on a burro and ride that shit home.

904
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:24,592
嘿 我可不需要小毛驴
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.

905
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,470
你两个礼拜的假请下来了吗?
Did you get your two weeks?

906
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,889
我打那么久卫星电话
All that time I was spending on the sat phone,

907
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:32,349
可不是在说服他们让我回家
it wasn't to convince them to let me go home,

908
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,602
而是想说服他们让你领导这次行动
it was to convince them to leave your ass in charge.

909
01:19:55,517 --> 01:19:59,602
美国与墨西哥边境 北纬32度 西经117度

910
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,463
- 长官  - 中尉
- Sir.  - Lieutenant.

911
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,757
看来政府真是想让咱们合作 是不?
Seems our governments have been very busy to make this possible, huh?

912
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,342
据我所知 是上头下来的命令
All the way to the top, from what I hear.

913
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,386
有些事你必须得明白
There is something that you have to understand.

914
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:54,348
我的上级 他们非常害怕墨西哥出个摩加迪沙
My superiors, they're very fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.

915
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,600
他们可不想这里再次上演 黑鹰坠落啊
No Black Hawk Down is what they're saying,

916
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,352
所以我们得低调行动
so we do need to stay under the radar.

917
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,479
- 我完全明白 长官  - 那就好
- I understand completely, sir.  - Good.

918
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:03,482
您的小组能来我们非常感激 但是我们时间紧迫
Your team's presence here is greatly appreciated, but we are out of time.

919
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,150
- 我们得立刻行动  - 告诉我去哪儿 我们立刻就走
- We need to move.  - Tell me where, we go.

920
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:06,360
帮我分析一下
Help piece this together for me.

921
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:07,820
- 好的  - 我们收到的情报是
- OK.  - Our intel says

922
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:10,656
他们用的是一家牛奶工厂下面的隧道网络
they're using a tunnel network that is under a milk factory.

923
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,783
你能想到什么吗?
This mean anything to you?

924
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,369
我知道确切位置 离这儿不远
I know exactly where that is. It's not far from here.

925
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,204
那我们就去那儿
Then that's where we're going.

926
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,164
在墨西卡利 你们去的这个地方
Of all of the places in Mexicali

927
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,333
大概是最危险的地方
that you could have picked, this is probably the worst.

928
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,502
墨西哥毒枭把那个地区守的严严实实
The cartels control that area from all angles.

929
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,337
我们火力不够
They have us heavily outgunned.

930
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,715
能接近你的目标就已经非常难了
Simply reaching your target is gonna be very difficult.

931
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,467
长官 现在有八个外籍人士想要进入我们国家
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals heading to our country.

932
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,970
不用说 他们不怀好意
Needless to say, they are no big fan of ours.

933
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,306
如果他们在那个工厂 我们就去那儿
If they are at that factory, that's where we're going.

934
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,641
中士 你要去哪儿我都带你去
Lieutenant, I'll take you anywhere you need to go,

935
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:40,811
但是你和你的人要做好准备 这将是一场你想象不到的恶战
but prepare your men for a bigger fight than what you had imagined.

936
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:44,148
你不仅是跟八个人战斗 你还要跟保护他们的墨西哥毒枭战斗
You're not fighting eight men. You're also fighting the cartel that's protecting them.

937
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,567
如果你的目标进入这些隧道
If your targets make it into those tunnels,

938
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,736
他们会像鬼一样消失
they'll disappear like ghosts.

939
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,881
你们从这儿进入隧道
You enter the tunnels right here.

940
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,175
然后走七英里到这个分叉口
You will walk seven miles to this fork.

941
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:36,927
我的人会告诉你们走哪条隧道
My men will tell you what tunnel to take.

942
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:41,598
一旦你到这个点 我的任务就算完成了
Once you get to this point, my job is done.

943
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,559
你们就自求多福了
You're on your own.

944
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,965
- 中士 我们要行动了!  - 收到
- Lieutenant, we're going now!  - Roger that.

945
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:40,657
长官 不要停 我们直逼目标
Chief, we're not stopping. We're rolling up on target, hard.

946
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:43,452
收到 长官 我们还有大概三十秒就到了
Roger that, sir. We're about 30 seconds out.

947
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,928
南面进口处有人影窜动
One mike out from the south entrance.

948
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,548
杰夫! 屋顶有人!
Jefe! On the roof!

949
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,186
我们得撤了 马上
We gotta go. Now.

950
01:26:08,469 --> 01:26:09,346
我们走

951
01:26:10,469 --> 01:26:12,346
你留在这儿

952
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:26,346
长官! 留两个人在这儿!
Sir! Leave two men here!

953
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,346
准备好 他们来了

954
01:26:55,084 --> 01:27:00,923
维明!
Weimy!

955
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,258
你把他们搞定他们!
I need you to lock this shit down!

956
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,310
扔雷了!
Frag out!

957
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:17,022
掩护我
On me.

958
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,800
你们去大门那边!
You guys got the gate!

959
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,511
卡尔! 你去前门!
Call! You're going to the front door!

960
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,640
上!
Go!

961
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,252
卡尔!
Call!

962
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,252
需要你的时候到了

963
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,252
怎么了?

964
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,752
你会在天堂见到你丈夫的

965
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,262
换弹夹!
Changing!

966
01:29:57,975 --> 01:30:00,477
有炸弹!
Bomb!

967
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:29,156
为什么停下来?

968
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,156
是你 长官
Damn it, sir.

969
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:55,657
刚才的事你怎么给我家人解释?
How you gonna explain that one to my family?

970
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,160
你回去我就不用解释了 是吧?
Get back there so I don't have to, huh?

971
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,719
安全!
Clear!

972
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:40,535
手榴弹!
Grenade!

973
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:41,096
中士!
LT!

974
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:46,059
长官 他交给我吧
Chief, I got him.

975
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:10,709
继续前进 我掩护你
Keep going. I'll cover you.

976
01:33:10,741 --> 01:33:11,709
进隧道

977
01:34:58,067 --> 01:34:59,275
长官
Chief.

978
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:06,700
长官!
Chief!

979
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:11,454
二分队 我是一分队
Assault Two, this is Assault One.

980
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:15,792
报告 隧道已经安全 所有威胁都已经解除
Be advised, tunnel is secure and all threats are neutralized.

981
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,128
中士和长官倒下了
LT and Chief are down.

982
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:21,297
再说一遍 中士和长官倒下了
I say again, LT and Chief are down.

983
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,731
你父亲是个好人
Your father was a good man.

984
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:22,317
成长中没有他的陪伴一定很艰难
Growing up without him is gonna be hard.

985
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:24,486
肯定会痛苦
It's gonna hurt.

986
01:36:24,653 --> 01:36:28,615
你会感到孤独 就像到了海里 看不到岸
You'll feel alone, out to sea, with no shore in sight.

987
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:32,786
你会问自己 "为什么我没父亲? 为什么我父亲死了?"
You'll wonder, "Why me? Why him?"

988
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:48,843
记住 你身体流着勇士的血
Remember, you have warrior's blood in your veins.

989
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:51,930
与你父亲一样 你身上遗传了他特有的遗传密码
The code that made your father who he was is the same code

990
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:55,850
使你成为了像他一样令人爱戴尊敬的人
that'll make you a man he would admire, respect.

991
01:36:57,311 --> 01:37:00,647
把你的痛苦放进一个盒子 锁上
Put your pain in a box. Lock it down.

992
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:03,858
就像你父亲喜欢的那些油画里的人一样
Like those people in the paintings your father liked,

993
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:08,571
我们的人生中有束缚 有失去 有胜利
we are men made up of boxes, chambers of loss and triumph,

994
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:12,075
有伤痛 有希望 有爱
of hurt and hope and love.

995
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:15,829
- 一个人如果能驾驭自己的感情...  - 准备!
- No one is stronger or more dangerous...  - Ready!

996
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:17,705
- ...那没有人比他更强大或者危险  - 瞄准!
- ...than a man who can harness his emotions.  - Aim!

997
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:20,250

# 我会做出如此牺牲吗? #
# Could I make that sacrifice? #

1048
01:43:36,418 --> 01:43:38,961
# 如果真要抉择 我会冲向枪口吗?
# If it came down to it Could I take the bullet? #

1049

# 我会 是的 我会 #

1050
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:45,968
# 为你献出生命 #
# For you #

1051
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:52,099
# 嗯-嗯 #
# Mm-hm #

1052
01:43:56,813 --> 01:43:59,398
# 或许你不明白 #
# Maybe you don't understand #

1053
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:03,819
# 我自己也不明白 #
# I don't understand it all myself #

1054
01:44:03,987 --> 01:44:07,865
# 但是兄弟们就在我身边 #
# But there's a brother on my left and another on my right #

1055
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:11,661
# 他的衣兜里也和我一样 #
# And in his pocket just like mine #

1056
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:15,289
# 放着一张照片 #
# He's got a photograph #

1057
01:44:15,457 --> 01:44:18,501
# 家人等待他回家 #
# And they're waiting for him back home #

1058
01:44:18,669 --> 01:44:20,962
# 这一直萦绕在我脑海 #
# And it's weighing on my mind #

1059
01:44:21,129 --> 01:44:24,048
# 我不是要做一个英雄 #
# I'm not trying to be a hero #

1060
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:26,842
# 我也不想死 #
# I don't wanna die #

1061
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:29,512
# 但在此时此刻 #
# But right now in this moment #

1062
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,139
# 你不能犹豫 #
# You don't think twice #

1063
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:37,395
# 我不知道我会不会献出我的生命 #
# I wonder Would I give my life #

1064
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:43,109
# 我会做出那样的牺牲吗? #
# Could I make that sacrifice? #

1065
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:48,030
# 如果真要抉择 我会冲向枪口吗? #

1067
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:57,707
# 不要想对 #
# You don't think about right #

1068
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:00,501
# 还是错 #
# You don't think about wrong #

1069
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:03,296
# 你只能履行职责 #
# You just do what you gotta do #

1070
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:06,090
# 捍卫自己的尊严 #
# To defend your own #

1071

# 我也会这样做 #
# And I'd do the same #

1076
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:51,969
# 因为当你真要抉择 #
# 'Cause if it came down to it #

1077
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:55,181
# 我愿冲向枪口吗? 我愿意 #
